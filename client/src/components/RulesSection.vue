            <p>
              The doubling cube is a fundamental element in backgammon that
              allows players to raise the stakes of the game. It's what makes
              backgammon not just a game of skill, but also a game of strategy.

            <h5 class="mb-2 font-bold">Basic Rules:</h5>
            <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
              <li>
                At the start of each game, either player has the right to
                propose doubling the stakes
              </li>
              <li>
                When a player is offered a double, they have two options:
                <ul class="list-circle mt-1 pl-6">
                  <li>
                    <span class="font-bold">Accept</span> - The game continues
                    with doubled stakes
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="font-bold">Decline</span> - The game ends and
                    the opponent wins the current stakes
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Once a double is accepted, the accepting player now owns the
                cube and is the only one who can offer the next double
              </li>
              <li>Each double multiplies the original stake by 2</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

            <h5 class="mb-2 font-bold">When to Use the Doubling Cube:</h5>
            <ul class="list-disc space-y-1 pl-4">
              <li>When you have a clear advantage in position</li>
              <li>When you have better chances of winning</li>
              <li>When your opponent is in a difficult position</li>
              <li>
                When you want to put psychological pressure on your opponent

            <p class="font-bold">Important Note:</p>
            <p>
              The doubling cube adds an extra layer of strategy to backgammon
              and can significantly impact the outcome of the game.
              Understanding when to offer and accept doubles is crucial for
              advanced play.

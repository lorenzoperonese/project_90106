\section{Code Base Requirements}

\subsection{Code Quality}
\begin{itemize}
    \item All code must follow camelCase naming conventions.
    \item Each module must have and pass its unit tests (and mocks if developed using TDD).
    \item No critical or major code smells or errors detected by static analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube).
    \item All APIs must provide a preview with Swagger and include specific API tests.
    \item For the main front-end pages, basic functionality must be tested through front-end testing.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Documentation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Documentation for each module: a markdown preview of the interface aligned with the UML class diagram.
    \item Main README updated with the latest features.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Merge Request}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Every merge request (MR) must be approved by the Scrum Master (SM) or Product Owner (PO).
    \item The MR must pass all tests in the Jenkins testing pipeline.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Interface}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards: compatible with all modern browsers.
    \item Responsive on laptops, tablets, and smartphones (portrait view only).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The app maintains acceptable performance (less than 2 seconds load time for the main game interface).
\end{itemize}

\section{Functional Requirements}

\subsection{User Interface}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Game board displays correctly on all standard screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
    \item Pieces, dice, and other game elements are visually clear and respond to user interactions.
    \item Dark mode and light mode supported if specified.
    \item Responsive animations and transitions meet UX standards.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Game Logic}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Users can start a new game and select opponent type (AI or another player).
    \item Players can roll the dice and move pieces according to Backgammon rules.
    \item Game correctly enforces Backgammon rules, including:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Setup:} Initial setup and movement.
        \item \textbf{Actions:} Capturing and releasing pieces.
        \item \textbf{Win:} Winning conditions (e.g., bearing off all pieces).
    \end{itemize}
    \item Game history or logs are available for review, showing moves made by each player.
\end{itemize}
\section{Deployment Requirements}
\subsection{Environment Compatibility}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Application successfully runs in the development and production environments.
    \item Application must need a configuration file, easy to configure that matches the deployment architecture.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Build and Release}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The application is buildable without errors or warnings.
    \item The app is configured for continuous integration and deployment, with automated testing on all merges.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Monitoring and Logging}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Real-time error monitoring and logging are set up (e.g., with Sentry).
    \item Logs capture critical events such as game starts, disconnections, and user errors.
\end{itemize}
